                <p class="about-content">My name is Bora and I am a Full-Stack Developer. I was born in Tirana, Albania and came to the US at the age of 16. Moving to NYC has given me the opportunity to explore even more languages that what I've alrady mastered. I have been on a hunt for purpose and truly finding something that resonates with me. In a midst of the pandemic I realized how much innovation meant to me, and the impactful difference it has made in my life. I came to the conclusion where my passion lies in languages, but this time I took the leap of faith to learn computer languages. As much as this journey has been a hard one, I have realized the potential we humans have in adaptability. I hold a bachelors of Behavioral Science with a concentration in Statistics, and decided to change careers in 2020 in a place where my creativity can flow.     </p>
